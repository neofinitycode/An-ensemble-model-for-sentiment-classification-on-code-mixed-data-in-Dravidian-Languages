# An-ensemble-model-for-sentiment-classification-on-code-mixed-data-in-Dravidian-Languages

This was part of the Sentiment Analysis of Dravidian Languages in Code-Mixed Text track in Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation 2021.

Task:</br>
This is a message-level polarity classification task. Given a Youtube comment, systems have to classify the comment into positive, negative, neutral, mixed emotions or if the comment is not in the intended language.</br>
The goal of this task is to identify sentiment polarity of the code-mixed dataset of comments/posts in Dravidian Languages (Malayalam-English and Tamil-English) collected from social media. The comment/post may contain more than one sentence but the average sentence length of the corpora is 1. Each comment/post is annotated with sentiment polarity at the comment/post level. This dataset also has class imbalance problems depicting real-world scenarios. Our proposal aims to encourage research that will reveal how sentiment is expressed in code-mixed scenarios on social media.
